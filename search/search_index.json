Known for its grand palaces, forts, and vibrant culture, Udaipur served as the capital of the Mewar kingdom and remains a major cultural and tourist center in Rajasthan. There are several attractions nearby. This includes Haldighati, a narrow mountain pass in Rajasthan, which is known for the famous Battle of Haldighati fought in 1576 between Maharana Pratap of Mewar and the Mughal army led by Man Singh.
