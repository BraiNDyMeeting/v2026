This annual event aims to foster the exchange of ideas and collaboration in the emerging field of brain dynamics, which encompasses dynamical systems, neuroscience, and related topics, utilizing both theoretical and empirical approaches.   Hosted at one of India's leading liberal arts and sciences universities, BraiNDy 2024 offers a unique interdisciplinary academic environment that is perfectly suited to the meeting's focus. The event will provide an informal setting, encouraging close interaction among researchers. We also welcome a limited number of participants who can register to attend and present their work in poster sessions.  This is an excellent opportunity for young researchers from various disciplines interested in brain dynamics to engage with established experts, share ideas, and explore potential collaborations.  </p>"},{"location":"Team/","title":"Organizing Team","text":"<ul> <li>Prof. Arpan Banerjee, NBRC Gurgaon</li> <li>Prof. Dipanjan Ray, IIT Jodhpur</li> <li>Prof. Dipanjan Ray, Ashoka University</li> </ul>"},{"location":"registration/","title":"Registration Details","text":"<p> We have a limited number of participant slots for the event, allowing selected attendees to present their work in poster sessions and engage with speakers and fellow participants, which is the primary focus of our meeting.
