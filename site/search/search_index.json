The city of Udaipur was founded by Maharana Udai Singh II in 1559, and is often called the ''City of Lakes'' for its picturesque water bodies like Lake Pichola and Fatehsagar. Known for its grand palaces, forts, and vibrant culture, Udaipur served as the capital of the Mewar kingdom and remains a major cultural and tourist center in Rajasthan.</p> <p></p> <p>There are several tourist attractions nearby. This includes Haldighati, a narrow mountain pass, which is known for the famous Battle of Haldighati fought in 1576 between Maharana Pratap of Mewar and the Mughal army led by Man Singh.
