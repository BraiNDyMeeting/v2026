<b>Virtual Brain Twins as vehicles to understand pattern formation in the brain</b></p>
<p align="justify">
In the past twenty years, we have made significant progress in creating digital models of an individual’s brain, so called virtual brain twins. By combining brain imaging data with mathematical models, we can predict outcomes more accurately than using each method separately. Our approach has helped us understand normal brain states, their operation and conditions like healthy aging, dementia and schizophrenia. We illustrate the virtual brain workflow along the example of drug resistant epilepsy and demonstrate some basic principles underlying the spatio-temporal pattern formation in brain-like networks.  </p>

<b>Seeking Universal Patterns across Connectomes</b></p>
<p align="justify">
Understanding how the brain functions requires identifying general design principles that can provide a conceptual scaffolding for describing the connectome. This talk will describe how (a) by looking across species and (b) looking across many individuals in a species, one can tease out indications of invariant organizational features that shape the dynamics and function of nervous systems. In particular, the talk will focus on the evidence for "modular hierarchy" that involves both modular partitioning and hierarchical layered arrangement of neurons/brain areas across different species, suggesting that nervous systems employ an optimal mix of parallel (modular) and sequential (hierarchic) information processing. It will also briefly touch upon the identification of an universal "backbone network" underlying the human brain obtained by analyzing an ensemble of DTI-based structural connectomes obtained for a wide cross-section of human subjects.  </p>

<b>Why the "D" in "FCD" ? Mechanisms and purpose of dynamic Functional Connectivity</b></p>
<p align="justify">
Functional connectivity describes the coordinated activity of distributed brain regions, typically estimated from correlations in neural time series such as resting-state fMRI. Traditionally, functional networks have been characterised over long time windows or across repeated trials. From a data-driven perspective, however, functional connectivity is inherently dynamic, undergoing continuous and spontaneous reconfiguration—a major source of neural variability, even in the absence of explicit task demands. This ongoing flow of connectivity, and more generally of coordinated brain states, has emerged as a powerful biomarker across a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions, including ageing, sleep deprivation, and neurological disorders. These dynamics reflect a delicate balance between order and disorder, which can be quantified using appropriate markers of network reconfiguration and update dynamics, and are observable across modalities, from invasive recordings in animals and patients to EEG and fMRI in both resting and task conditions.

In this talk, drawing on past and ongoing work from our team, I will address the question of why functional connectivity is dynamic. First, in a mechanistic sense: how can flexible yet structured connectivity dynamics emerge from largely fixed large-scale cortical circuits? What insights can be gained from dynamical models that faithfully reproduce subtle but critical features of empirical FCD? This line of inquiry leads us to revisit the prevalent hypothesis that brain networks operate near criticality, and to propose an alternative framework, which we term the critical roaming scenario.

I will then turn to a second, more functional interpretation of why: what computational or cognitive advantage might arise from maintaining a continuously evolving connectivity landscape, beyond adaptations explicitly driven by task or context? Using generative models of dynamic functional connectivity with increasing levels of detail, I will explore hypotheses according to which spontaneous reconfiguration enables a compromise between the simultaneous optimisation of integrative and segregative modes of information processing.

Overall, our results support the view that dynamic functional connectivity should be regarded not as nuisance variability to be averaged out, but as a structured computational resource actively exploited by the brain.  </p>

<b>Modelling brain dynamics on long time scales</b></p>
<p align="justify">
Brain activity unfolds on an extremely wide range of time scales, though most effort to date has focused on studying relatively short time scales of milliseconds to minutes. In models, different brain states often map to different sets of parameter values, but then questions remain on how models parsimoniously explain transitions between different states, and how brain activity matures and ages. This talk will present work on modelling “slow” variables beyond the traditional neuronal ones. For example there are slow changes on the order of hours in metabolic and ionic availability, and circadian and homeostatic processes, and on longer time scales still these dynamics evolve across the lifespan. Applications include recovery from hypoxic injury and the maturation of sleep patterns. Many possibilities remain to be pursued, discussion of which will hopefully inspire new models explaining dynamics on time scales of hours, days, months, and years.  </p>

<b>Critical brain dynamics of network oscillations</b></p>
<p align="justify">
Network-oscillations are fundamental for human cognition. Especially, phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations is considered as a mechanism for routing information processing across neuronal circuits. Yet, there is wide variability of both individual coupling levels and their spatio-temporal patterns. Using computational modelling and experimental MEG data, we have shown that the variability can be explained in the framework of brain criticality by individual operating points along an extended critical-like dynamics – the Griffiths Phase. 
I will discuss these results and propose that the extended critical regime yields functional advantages of criticality over a wider range of operating point values. This could lead to individual differences in neural circuit level and behavioral and cognitive performance.  </p>

<b>Time-varying spectral graph model describes the dynamics of abnormal neural oscillations in Alzheimer's disease</b></p>
<p align="justify">
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with marked changes in brain rhythms, often reflected as shifts in spectral content and altered excitatory-inhibitory balance of neural activity. However, how such oscillatory changes relate to biophysical processes at both local (neural population level) and global (network level) scales of brain organization remains poorly understood. In this work, we examine a time-varying modeling framework that links brain oscillatory power to underlying network structure, using noninvasive neural recordings. This approach enables characterization of dynamic interactions between large-scale network properties and local neural population dynamics. Our results indicate that AD brains tend to occupy distinct dynamical regimes characterized by altered network coordination and regional activity patterns. Furthermore, we show that network dynamics not only reflect important features that distinguish AD from controls but also relate to cognitive decline in AD patients. Together, these findings provide a unifying biophysical perspective on oscillatory dysfunction in AD and offer a general framework for studying multiscale brain dynamics and their relevance to clinical outcomes. </p>

<b>Collective dynamics in the presence of higher-order interactions</b></p>

<p align="justify">Complex physical systems, such as the brain, are governed by interactions that extend beyond pairwise connections, emphasizing the need to systematically connect system parameters to observed macroscopic phenomena in such scenarios. To this end, I will first introduce hypergraphs as the mathematical formalism for representing higher-order interactions, and subsequently investigate their implications across two different mathematical models in neuroscience. In particular, I will primarily discuss how higher-order interactions affect different aspects of synchronization, which is regarded as the key mechanism underlying epilepsy, using extended versions of the Kuramoto model. Subsequently, I will also highlight the influence of such interactions on the dynamics of a collection of active and inactive neurons in a mechanistic model of damage/aging. Taken together, the analytical and numerical results highlight how higher-order interactions impact transitions between different collective states and can provide insights into empirically observed neural dynamics.</p>

Modern cognitive science frequently operates under the "Exclusive OR" (⊕) fallacy—the fragmentation of the human experience into isolated silos of neural activity, mental states, biological drives, or social structures. In the MBBS (Mind-Brain-Body-Society) Lab, we reject this reductionism in favor of an integrated, non-reducible framework. This talk presents a series of studies that utilize Neuroimaging, Network Science, and Virtual Reality to decode the "informational grammar" that links these domains.

We begin by examining the brain’s physical and functional scaffolding. Using multiplex network analysis, we demonstrate that healthy aging is characterized by a systematic "information divergence," specifically a subcortical decoupling where primary relay stations move away from their structural constraints. We further apply this multilayer approach to the "Nature vs. Nurture" debate, showing that heritability is not a uniform value but is cytoarchitecturally specific, with genetic anchors in granular regions and environmental flexibility in dysgranular workspaces.

Transitioning to cognition as an active, generative process, we explore the hierarchical nature of perception. Through spectral Dynamic Causal Modeling (sDCM), we show that chronic pain and the placebo response are not mere reactions to stimuli but are constructions of a predictive hierarchy, where top-down expectations modulate ascending sensory signals. This "subjective filter" is further evidenced in our work on music, where we find that while the "energy" (arousal) of a Raga is a universal bottom-up response, its "feeling" (valence) is a top-down construction shaped by the listener’s personality and mood.

Finally, we address the embodied and embedded nature of the self. We present evidence that the "Self" is a malleable prediction that can be re-modeled through Virtual Reality (VR) embodiment. We conclude by mapping the biopsychosocial networks of eating behavior in India, revealing that the system is integrated not by body-image concerns, but by socio-economic "bridges" like education and employment. Together, these projects argue for a neuroscience that does not simplify the human experience, but finally respects its inherent, integrated complexity. </p>

<b>The rasa in the raga: Explorations of the emotional landscape of North Indian Classical Music</b></p>

<p align="justify">The central notion in North Indian Classical Music (NICM) is that of a raga. The
ragas of North Indian Classical Music (NICM), constitute specific combinations of
tonic intervals and have been historically known to elicit emotions also called ‘rasas’.
However, little empirical research has been conducted to test the raga-rasa theory.
We designed behavioural and neuroimaging experiments to test the raga-rasa
theory. In experiment one, we elicited behavioural emotional responses to eight
ragas to investigate (a) emotions experienced across ragas (b) the association of
tonic intervals, tempo and rhythmic regularity with emotional response. In experiment
two, we studied neural circuity underlying emotional responses to ragas using
functional neuroimaging.
I will discuss the results of both behavioural and neuroimaging experiments and
highlight how the structure of raga stimuli can be harnessed to delineate the role of
rhythm and tonality in music.</p>
