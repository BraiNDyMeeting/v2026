Join us for the 2nd edition of the Brain Network Dynamics Meeting (BraiNDy 2026) at Udaipur from December 14-15, 2024. This annual event aims to foster the exchange of ideas and collaboration in the emerging field of brain dynamics, which encompasses dynamical systems, neuroscience, and related topics, utilizing both theoretical and empirical approaches.<br><br>


Hosted at one of India's leading liberal arts and sciences universities, BraiNDy 2024 offers a unique interdisciplinary academic environment that is perfectly suited to the meeting's focus. The event will provide an informal setting, encouraging close interaction among researchers. We also welcome a limited number of participants who can register to attend and present their work in poster sessions.  This is an excellent opportunity for young researchers from various disciplines interested in brain dynamics to engage with established experts, share ideas, and explore potential collaborations.
